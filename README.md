# ChessEngine
This repository contains two main branches:

chess-sequential – The original sequential version of the chess engine, running all evaluation and move-generation tasks in a single-threaded manner.

chess-parallel – The parallelized version of the engine, designed to improve performance by distributing computation across multiple threads.
